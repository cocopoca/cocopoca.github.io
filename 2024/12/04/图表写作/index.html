<p>The pie chart clearly  illustrates the different purposes for which students at a certain university use their phones for reading. The purposes are mainly divided into four categories. The data reveals that D of students use their phones for learning knowledge. Next, D of students use their phones for passing time, and D  for gaining information. Other purposes account for D.</p>

Secondly, having a lot of knowledge  is extremely important for students in finding jobs and future. </p>
<p><code>Moreover</code>,<code>In addition</code>Therefore, students are more inclined to sue their phones for reading to acquire knowledge.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, we can draw the conclusion  that an increasing number of people are willing to exercise alone  and the trend may continue in the future. because it aligns with the features of modern university students and our times.</p>
<p><code>Certainly, no matter  which way of exercise you choose, it&#39;s the action that counts.</code></p>

The data reveals that 37% of students travel for enjoying scenery. Next, 33% of students travel for relieving stress. Making friends and developing independence account for 9% and 6%, respectively. Other purposes account for 15%.</p>
<p>The above percentages reflect students’ tendency to enjoy scenery and relieve stress. We can attribute this phenomenon to the following aspects:</p>
<p>To begin with, the natural beauty and cultural experiences provided by travel offer a significant attraction for many students.</p>
<p>Secondly, the pressures of academic life and daily routines make it essential for students to find ways to relax and unwind.</p>

<p>The chart clearly illustrates the different selections of graduate students at a certain university in 2013 and 2018. The selections are mainly divided into three categories. The data reveals that 68.1% of students selected to join jobs, 26.3% selected to continue learning, and only 1.3% selected to become founders in 2013. Compared with 2013, the percentage of students joining jobs decreased in 2018, while the percentages for continuing learning and becoming founders increased.</p>
<p>The above percentages reflect students’ changes in graduate selections. We can attribute this phenomenon to the following aspects:</p>
<p>To begin with, the job market has become more competitive, leading students to seek further education or entrepreneurial opportunities.</p>
<p>Secondly, the availability of funding and support for startups has increased, making entrepreneurship a more viable option.</p>
<p>Moreover, the emphasis on lifelong learning and skill development has encouraged more students to pursue further education.</p>
<p>In addition, the changing economic landscape has made traditional job paths less appealing, driving students towards alternative career paths.</p>
<p>Therefore, based on the above reasons, we can draw the conclusion that an increasing number of students are choosing to continue their education or start their own businesses, and this trend may continue in the future because it aligns with the features of modern university students and our times.</p>

<p>The bar chart illustrates the changes in China’s express delivery volume from 2018 to 2020, comparing the total volume and rural volume separately. Over the three-year period, the <code>total express delivery volume</code> saw a significant increase, rising from 51 billion pieces in 2018 to 83 billion pieces in 2020. Similarly, the rural express delivery volume also experienced growth, increasing from 12 billion pieces in 2018 to 30 billion pieces in 2020.</p>
<p>These trends suggest a growing reliance on e-commerce and online shopping across China, particularly in rural areas. The expansion of logistics infrastructure and improved accessibility to online services likely contributed to this rise. Moreover, the increasing popularity of online platforms may have encouraged more people to purchase goods remotely, further driving up the demand for express delivery services.</p>

<p>The bar chart shows the changes in the Air Quality Index (AQI) in four big Chinese cities—Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen—from 2010 to 2020. This chart helps us understand how the air quality has changed in these cities over the years.</p>
<p>In Beijing, the AQI went down a lot, from 120 in 2010 to 80 in 2020. This big drop means the air quality got much better, probably because of strong environmental rules and actions taken by the government. Shanghai also saw a similar change, with its AQI going down from 110 to 75, showing that the city is working hard to reduce pollution.On the other hand, Guangzhou’s AQI stayed almost the same, between 90 and 100. This means the air quality in Guangzhou didn’t change much, even though the city is trying to keep it steady. In Shenzhen, the AQI went up a little, from 70 to 85. This small increase is worrying and shows that the air quality is getting worse, which needs attention.</p>
<p>Overall, the chart tells us that Beijing and Shanghai have done a good job in improving air quality, thanks to their strong environmental policies. However, Guangzhou’s air quality didn’t change much, and Shenzhen’s got worse. These results show that different cities need different plans to deal with pollution and keep the environment clean.</p>

<p>两个句子中使用 “when” 的情况不同，主要是因为它们所描述的关系和动作的性质不同。让我们来分析一下这两个句子：</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>关于顾客选择餐厅的因素：</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“The pie chart illustrates the different factors that customers in a certain city considered when choosing a restaurant in 2017.”</li>
<li>在这个句子中，”when” 用来连接两个事件：顾客考虑某些因素（the different factors that customers considered）和他们选择餐厅的动作（choosing a restaurant）。这里 “when” 表示的是时间点或时间段，即在顾客做选择的那个时刻，他们在考虑这些因素。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>关于学生使用手机阅读的目的：</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“The pie chart illustrates the different purposes for which students at a certain university used their phones for reading in 2017.”</li>
<li>在这个句子中，”for which” 是用来引导定语从句，修饰 “purposes”。这里的重点是学生使用手机阅读的具体目的，而不是在特定的时间点上发生的动作。因此，不需要用 “when” 来表示时间关系。”in 2017” 则是用来限定这一行为发生的时间范围，但不是为了表示某个具体的选择时刻。</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>总结来说，第一个句子中的 “when” 强调了在做出选择时考虑的因素，而第二个句子中的 “for which” 更关注于行为的目的。如果在第二个句子中使用 “when”，则可能会改变句子的意思，暗示学生是在特定的时间点决定使用手机阅读，这并不是句子想要传达的主要信息。</p>
